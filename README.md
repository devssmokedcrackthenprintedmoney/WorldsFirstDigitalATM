This is the world's first non-centralized blockchain. "What does this mean?" you ask. On an axis of centralized vs. decentralized, our blockchain is "more decentralized" than decentralization itself. That's how ultra-decentralized the non-centralized bank we've created is. This is an innovation centuries ahead of its time. You can directly withdraw money via a pull request, and all withdrawls are free, though need to be approved by this username. This is a cryptocurrency with a totally centralized onramp: this ATM

Our username will not use or withdraw from the ATM

If you thought about using the ATM, that shows your interest in our money. When you turn around and exchange our money for dollars, other people will be interested just like you were interested in using the ATM. Remember that when you're making a sale. This belief is critical for a serious currency
